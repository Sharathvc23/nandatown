"""Byzantine-resistant gossip registry plugin — scaffold (Task 1 of the series).

``nest_plugins_reference.registry.gossip.GossipRegistry`` gives us
eventually-consistent discovery under honest-but-partitioned failures: every
agent gossips its local view over the transport, and the simulator's
partition logic naturally blocks cross-partition propagation.  It assumes,
however, that every participant plays by the rules — same publisher never
signs two conflicting write tags at the same version, no agent forges
another agent's cards, and no agent tries to starve a victim's view by only
ever gossiping with a captured subset of peers.

This plugin is the byzantine-hardened counterpart.  Task 1 scaffolded the
class and proved it satisfies ``nest_core.layers.registry.Registry`` — the
view/merge/wire-format machinery is a deliberate copy of
``GossipRegistry``'s structure, while the network-wide primitives
(``GossipNetwork``, ``GOSSIP_PREFIX``, ``OP_DIGEST``, ``OP_PUSH``,
``_WriteTag``) are imported and reused as-is so both plugins share one
notion of "peer set" and "write ordering."

Task 2 (this task) adds the core moat: **every card is signed at
registration and re-verified on every gossip hop, not just once at
registration time.**  Prior art for signed cards exists (``#67``:
registration-only signing — a publisher signs its card when it first
registers).  That is necessary but not sufficient: ``#67``'s check runs
exactly once, at the source, and nothing downstream re-checks a card as it
hops through the gossip mesh.  A compromised or malicious relay agent can
forge a card claiming another agent's identity (impersonation) or mutate a
previously-honest card's bytes in transit (forgery) and any peer that only
trusts "it must be fine, gossip is honest-but-partitioned" will merge it
straight into its view.  This plugin closes that gap: ``handle_gossip``'s
``OP_PUSH`` branch verifies ``identity.verify(canonical_write_bytes(card,
tag.version, tombstone), sig, card.agent_id)`` for every incoming card and
drops (never ``_apply``s) anything that is unsigned, claims a signer other
than its own ``agent_id`` (impersonation), or fails cryptographic
verification (forgery/mutation) — recording ``(agent_id, reason)`` in
``self.rejections`` for judge/validator legibility with reason codes
``missing_signature``, ``signer_mismatch``, and ``bad_signature``, mirroring
``#67``'s taxonomy.

Critically, the signature binds not just the card's *content* but also its
**write tag (version) and tombstone bit**.  Content-only signing (sign
``agent_id``/``name``/``capabilities``/``endpoint``, nothing else) leaves a
gap of its own: the wire-supplied ``_WriteTag`` and ``tombstone`` in an
``OP_PUSH`` entry are merged verbatim once the *card* checks out, so a relay
with **no private key at all** can replay a genuinely-signed card under a
forged, inflated ``version`` (winning last-writer-wins against the
publisher's real future writes, i.e. blocking updates) or with a flipped
``tombstone`` bit (resurrecting a deregistered agent — an "un-delete" — or
silently deleting a live one).  Binding the signature to
``(content, version, tombstone)`` closes that: a replayed card with a
tampered tag or tombstone now fails verification and is dropped as
``bad_signature``, exactly like a forged/mutated card.

Task 3 (this task) closes the gap the module docstring above used to end
on: a publisher who signs two *different*, both validly-signed cards at the
same version (equivocation). Signature verification alone cannot detect
that — both cards individually pass every check Task 2 added, and ``#67``'s
registration-only signing would happily accept either one too, since it
only ever checks a card against *itself*, never against the publisher's
other writes. That is exactly the invariant registration-signing cannot
provide: **both equivocating cards are validly signed by their claimed
publisher.** The only way to catch this is to compare a publisher's writes
to each other, not to a signature. This plugin keeps a witness map from
``(publisher_id, version)`` to a content hash of the first verified write it
saw at that key; a second *verified* card at the same key with a
*different* hash proves the publisher signed two conflicting writes, which
is only possible if the publisher itself is byzantine (a relay cannot forge
this — see ``canonical_write_bytes``, version and tombstone are signed).
The publisher is quarantined on the spot: its card is evicted from the
local view, the conflict is recorded in ``self.equivocations``, and every
subsequent card from that publisher — genuinely signed or not — is refused
without re-litigating the question. Task 4 adds eclipse-resistant peer
sampling + adversarial scenarios and validators.

    """Canonical bytes of a **write** — ``card`` content plus ``version`` and ``tombstone``.

    This is what gets signed and verified, not ``canonical_card_bytes``
    alone. Binding the signature to the write tag and tombstone bit (in
    addition to content) closes a replay hole: without it, a relay holding
    no private key can take a genuinely-signed card and re-broadcast it
    under a forged, inflated ``version`` (winning last-writer-wins against
    the publisher's real future writes) or with a flipped ``tombstone`` bit
    (resurrecting a deregistered agent, or deleting a live one) — the card's
    *content* signature still checks out because content-only signing never
    covered the tag or tombstone in the first place. Still excludes
    ``metadata`` for the same circularity reason as ``canonical_card_bytes``.
